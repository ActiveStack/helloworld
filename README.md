Hello World
===========

This example will give you an example of a very basic project. It will show you how to run all parts of the ActiveStack and youâ€™ll be able to watch ActiveStack synchronize your javascript clients as you add, remove and change the colors of some blocks.

## Installation

### 0. Prerequisites

  * Node >= 0.10
  * Java SDK >= 1.5
  * MySQL >= 5.0
  * Redis >= 2.4
  * RabbitMQ v2.8

### 1. Clone the project repository 

```bash
> git clone git@github.com/ActiveStack/HelloWorld.git
```

### 2. Init and install submodules

```bash
> cd HelloWorld
> git submodule init
> git submodule update
```

## Start it!

### 0. Start Prereqs

Depending on how you have MySQL, Redis and RabbitMQ servers installed you might do this differently but here is a good faith best guess:

```bash
# New term window
> mysqld
# New term window
> redis-server
# New term window
> rabbitmq-server
```

### 1. Start the Gateway Server

```bash
> cd gateway
> npm install
> node src/server.js resources/no_ssl.properties
```

### 2. Start the Worker process

In another bash window/tab
```bash
> cd helloworld/worker
> mvn package
> java -jar target/helloworld_worker-0.0.1.one-jar.jar
```

### 3. Start the Client Web Server

In yet another bash window/tab
```bash
> cd helloworld/client
> http-server 8081
```

## Use it!

  * Open up two different browsers to http://localhost:8081 and login with a google account
  * Add blocks, remove blocks and change the block color by clicking on them. 
  * Cool how it syncs up in real time right!?
